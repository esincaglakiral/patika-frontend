  <p>Ceyda, a journalist is abducted by ISIS terrorists while she is covering a story on Yezidi people and their story of long-suffering and abandonment. A Turkish special force team of seven headed by Commander Veysel flies out to rescue her. We see the events through the eyes of Oğuz as the film begins in medias res. His flashbacks show us the life and memories of these men up until they came to the rescue mission. Oğuz and Bekir are best of friends and was saved by two Special Force commandos who laid their lives on the line for Oğuz and Bekir which is a determining factor in their joining the force.</p>
